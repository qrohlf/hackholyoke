# Bam

The main goal of Bam is to produce a javascript build system that I actually enjoy using. 

## Planned Features
- SASS compilation & minification bower files automatically in the include path via gulp
- 

# Notes

for node canvas you will need to do something like this:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig npm install
